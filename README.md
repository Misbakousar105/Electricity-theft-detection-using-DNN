# Electricity Theft Detection in Smart Grids Using Deep Neural Networks

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting electricity theft in smart grids using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Electricity theft is a significant challenge in modern power systems, 
leading to massive non-technical losses. By analyzing consumption patterns from smart meters, the proposed system identifies anomalies and suspicious activities with high 
accuracy, contributing to the overall efficiency and security of smart grid infrastructure.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Electricity theft contributes to financial losses and unreliable grid operations. Traditional detection methods are often inefficient in real-time, large-scale systems.
This project proposes a deep learning-based approach that automatically detects irregular usage behavior, providing a scalable and automated solution.

## 💡 Key Features
- Detection of abnormal electricity consumption patterns.
- Use of Deep Neural Networks for classification and anomaly detection.
